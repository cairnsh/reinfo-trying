A big directory of disorganized reinforcement learning stuff for the matrix games project.
There is also an implementation of VMPO.

How to run this code

To set up the environment, do something like:

    conda create -ngame python<3.10 numpy scipy pytorch -c pytorch
    conda activate game

    pip install -e vmpo

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3
    pip install -e stable_baselines3

The -e option lets you edit the modules and have their changes reflected in the python thing.
